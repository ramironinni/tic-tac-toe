# Tic Tac Toe
### This is a challenge from The Odin Project JS Full Stack Path. 

- It's written in vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. No frameworks needed.
- I've implemented some handrwitten notebook style because I used to play this game with sheets, markers and pencils when I was a child.
- It has encouraged me to write clean code using factory functions and the module pattern. 
- I've learned some interesting things about game logic as well. I've had to figure it out how to translate that logic to functional JavaScript code: how to storage the moves, how to validate them, how to toggle the user after every move, how to check for a winner, how to display this stuff on the screen and so on.
- I hope you enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed coding it!
